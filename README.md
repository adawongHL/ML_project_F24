# Write-up

## Introduction
- [ ] Describe the dataset.
- [ ] Explain the problem you aim to solve.

## Unsupervised Analysis
- [ ] Explore patterns or structure using clustering and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).
- [ ] Visualize training data:
  - [ ] Plot individual feature distributions (e.g., histograms, density plots).
  - [ ] Plot relationships between features and the target variable.
  - [ ] Create a correlation matrix.
- [ ] Discuss any interesting structures or explain attempts to find them.

## Supervised Analysis
- [ ] Train >=3 different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, CNN)
- [ ] Use the following for implementation:
  - [ ] Custom implementation or existing libraries (e.g., Keras, scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
- [ ] Experiment with different feature transformations (at least three, e.g., polynomial, PCA, radial-basis function kernel).
- [ ] Apply different regularization techniques (at least six values per model).
- [ ] Document all transformations and regularization results.

## Table of Results
- [ ] Include training accuracy and validation metrics for every model.
- [ ] Provide results for varying parameter settings:
  - [ ] Classification metrics (e.g., precision, recall).
  - [ ] Regression metrics (e.g., MSE, RÂ²).
- [ ] Plot and analyze performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, MSE) with different transformations and hyperparameters.

## Analytical Discussion
- [ ] Analyze and explain experimental results.
- [ ] Include a chart of key findings.
- [ ] Discuss the impact of:
  - [ ] Feature transformations.
  - [ ] Regularization techniques.
  - [ ] Other hyperparameters on model performance.
- [ ] Interpret:
  - [ ] Overfitting and underfitting observations.
  - [ ] Bias-variance trade-offs.
  - [ ] Parameter choices improving generalization.

## Submission Requirements
- [ ] Upload the following to Gradescope:
  - [ ] Presentation slides.
  - [ ] Project write-up (PDF format).
  - [ ] Project code as a Jupyter Notebook (or GitHub link, if necessary).
  - [ ] Custom dataset (if used, either upload or provide a GitHub link).
